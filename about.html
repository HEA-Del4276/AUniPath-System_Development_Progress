    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        AUniPath is a website designed to help senior high school students in the Philippines 
        choose the right college course, university, and scholarship based on their academic track and interests. 
        It provides organized and reliable information on degree programs, schools, and scholarship opportunities, 
        along with updates on entrance exams and academic events. The platform aims to prevent course mismatches, 
        a common issue caused by lack of guidance, which often leads to academic struggles or dropout.
